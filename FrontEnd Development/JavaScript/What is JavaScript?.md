JavaScript (also known as ECMAScript) started its life as a simple scripting language for browsers. At the time it was invented, it was expected to be used for short snippets of code embedded in a web page. Due to this, early web browsers executed such code pretty slow.

Web browser developers responded to this increased JavaScript usage by optimising their  execution **engines** (dynamic compilation) and extending what could be done with it (adding APIs), which in turn made web developers use it even more.

More than this, JS has become popular enough to be used outside the context of browsers, such as implementing JS servers using **node JS**. The “run anywhere” nature of JS makes it an attractive choice for cross-platform development.
